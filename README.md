# Note from author

> This repository is archived. I am keeping it around because it demonstrates implementing a REST API using the Flask framework, and it demonstrates using the Signleton design pattern in Python. Was a fun project overall, and I hope I am able to do something more interesting with the patterns implemented within this code base in the future!
